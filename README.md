# La Boot'ique :handbag: :dress: :tophat:

## The website
Simple Ecommerce with extern payment method. I made this website mainly to learn how to use a payment API, Easy Admin, and a mailer. Any user can suscribe, and then purchase any products. Of course, this is a test version of Strip, you can't really use your card. But still, a validation will be set, and you'll receive a confirmation mail. If you use the contact section, I will reveive an email from the website.
As an admin, we can add products, modify banners, top products, handle users, carriers, categories and orders.
